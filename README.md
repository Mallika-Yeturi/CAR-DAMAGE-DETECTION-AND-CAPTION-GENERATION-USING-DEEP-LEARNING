# CAR-DAMAGE-DETECTION-AND-CAPTION-GENERATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

Car damage detection and caption generation play a vital role in expediting insurance claims, vehicle inspections, and automotive repair processes. This paper introduces an end-to-end deep learning-based framework that integrates a YOLOv7 object detection model with a Transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) module to localize and describe car damages automatically. We present our motivation for automating vehicle inspections, review the related work in both computer vision and NLP, and detail our dataset preparation, model architecture, training pipeline, and experimental results. Our system demonstrates high accuracy in detecting various damage categories , such as dents, scratches, and crushed areas, alongside generating coherent and contextually relevant captions. The proposed approach offers a scalable and reliable solution, minimizing manual labor and improving consistency in damage assessment across the automotive industry.
